# Tech-Frontend-Challenge Response

This is the result of a technical test for ABA english. The following objectives have been tried to solve:

# Goals/Outcomes/Requirements Faced‚úÖ
- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently
- Link to the source code, use your favorite repository manager (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- Link to the deployed Demo, use your favorite static site hosting platform (surge, github-pages, now, ...)
- The app should run on any computer by running npm install , npm test and have a demo online.
- Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`

# What have I not solved? ‚ùå
- Any test was implemented, so any test was passed. The main reason has been due to a lack of time and knowledge, as it is a long test I have decided to focus my efforts on other points.
- Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*, for the same time reasons explained above.
