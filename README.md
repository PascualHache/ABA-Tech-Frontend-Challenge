# Tech-Frontend-Challenge Response

This is the result of a technical test for ABA english. The following objectives have been tried to solve:

# Goals/Outcomes/Requirements Faced‚úÖ
- To test knowledge of consuming APIs and handling responses
- Loading state and knowing where and how to make multiple API calls efficiently
- Link to the source code, use your favorite repository manager (GitHub, GitLab, ...)
- The app should run on any computer by running npm install , npm test and have a demo online.
- Fetch and display *Released This Week* songs
  - Use the API path `new-releases`
- Fetch and display *Featured Playlists*
  - Use the API path `featured-playlists`
- Fetch and display *Browse* genres
  - Use the API path `categories`
- UX/UI Screenshots reference:

# What have I not solved? ‚ùå
- Any test was implemented, so any test was passed. The main reason has been due to a lack of time and knowledge, as it is a long test I have decided to focus my efforts on other points.
- Loading state/UI *(optional, current UX is already clean)*, for the same time reasons explained above.
- Link to the deployed Demo, use your favorite static site hosting platform (surge, github-pages, now, ...). I've been strugglin with the redirection auth process and due the lack of time i've decided not finish that point

# Before run it ‚öôÔ∏è
- After npm install, when npm start ensure that the project is runnin on the port 3000. Spotify API is setted to redirect to http://localhost:3000/ 
- This project is consuming Spotify API so an client ID is required. Is is demanded on the first project screen and if is not correct the project doesnt work. If the client ID isn't provided by me, ask me by email: hector.pascual.diaz@gmail.com
